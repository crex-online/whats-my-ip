#whats-my-ip
What's my ip Address?
========

Project
-------

Live example:  http://monger.us/ipaddress/

Displays client's ip address in web browser via PHP script retrieving $_SERVER[] values.

This is not a reliable or secure way to identify/track a user,  it can be easily stumped with a proxy or vpn.
